## Description
The SVG Logo Generator provides users with an easy-to-use program to create a custom SVG logo. User input taken from a series of prompts is applied to the program to produce an SVG logo using either a circle, triangle, or square shape.

Future development for this app could include additional design parameters for the user to choose from to produce non-standard shapes and custom color preferences such as borders and opacity.

> üìù **Easter Egg:** Entering "ILY" and choosing the circle shape will generate a fun surpirse!

## Installation
* [Inquirer v8.2.4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) must be installed to operate this app.
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) must be installed to operate testing for this app.
* [VS Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) is required to open the logo.svg via the browser.
